# Mighty

Mighty is a Korean point-trick game where all the cards 10 and above are worth one point each.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 5, in variable partnership

**Cards** A standard 52-card deck plus one joker, 53 cards. Aces are high. All of the cards 10 and above are worth one point each, 20 points in total. There are three "magic" cards that have special powers.

- **The Mighty** ♠A or ♦A, when spades are trump. The Mighty is the single highest card. It is considered part of its normal suit; not the trump suit. It may be played to any trick regardless of the suit led and cards in hand, but must otherwise follow standard rules. This means that a player may play the Mighty to a hearts trick even if they still hold hearts in their hand. But, if the Mighty is the last spade in a player's hand and spades are led, then the player must play the Mighty.
- **The Joker** The Joker is the second highest ranked card. It is not part of any suit and may be played to any trick regardless of the suit led and cards in hand. It may not be played to the first or the last trick. If it is led to a trick, the player must announce the suit the others must follow.
- **The Joker Hunter** ♣3 or ♠3, when clubs are trump. It may not be led to the first trick. If the Joker Hunter is led to a trick, and only then, it forces the player who holds the Joker to play it on their turn. The Joker loses its power and is no longer considered the second highest card. However, if the player with the Joker also has the Mighty, then they may play the Mighty instead, which is unaffected by the Joker Hunter.

**Objective** Work with your partner to capture at least as many point cards in tricks as were bid.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **10 cards** to each player and 3 cards to the stock.

## Bidding

The **dealer** starts the auction. Each player must either raise the bid or pass. Once a player passes they may not bid again. The auction continues until all but one player have passed. The remaining player is the declarer. If everyone passes without bidding, the hand is thrown in.

A bid is comprised of the minimum number of card-points the player thinks they can take in tricks with the help of a partner and a trump suit or no trump. The minimum bid is 13. All trump suits are equal and no trump out ranks them. This means that a bid of 13♠ can be out bid by 13 no trump or anything at the 14 level or higher.
Calling a Partner

The declarer takes the blind into their hand and discards back to 10 cards. The discarded cards count for the declarer at the end of the hand. After discarding, the declarer may optionally increase their bid level by 2 to change trump to a different suit. However, if they change to no trump the level only increases by 1.

Finally, the declarer calls the holder of a specific card as their secret partner. The declarer's partner may reveal their identity after winning a trick. Otherwise, it's only revealed when they play the called card. Alternatively, the declarer can call their partner off or call for a card in their own hand, if they want to play alone.

## Play

The **declarer** leads the first trick. On the first trick, they may not lead trump, the Joker, or the Joker Hunter. Standard trick-taking rules apply apart from the exceptions for the "magic" cards noted above.

Captured point cards are displayed face up in front of the player who took them. Once the identity of the declarer's partner is known, each team displays their cards together.

## Scoring

Mighty uses hard score. The basic payment value of a hand is the number bid minus 12.

If the declarer's team takes at least as many points as they bid, then two members of the opposing team each pay the declarer the value of the hand and the third member pays the declarer's partner. If the declarer's team took all 20 points, then the basic payment value is doubled.

For example, if the declarer bid 15 and takes 17, the declarer gains 6 points, their partner gains 3 points, and each of the other players lose 3 points each.

If the declarer's team does not take as many points as they bid, then the declarer pays two members of the opposing team the value of the hand and their partner pays the third. If the declarer's team only took 9 or fewer points, then the payment value is doubled.

If the declarer played alone they make and receive all payments.
