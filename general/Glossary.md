#### Card-Points

In point-trick games, the point values assigned to specific cards. These points are often used to determine who won the hand, and are not necessarily related to the number of points a player scores for winning a hand.

#### Contract

An agreement that a player or team must fulfill in order to win a hand. Typically this entails winning a certain number of tricks or points.

#### Cross-wise Partnership

The players sitting directly across the table from each other, with an opponent on either side, play on the same team for the entirety of the game.

#### Dealer

The player who is responsible for shuffling and dealing the cards for a hand.

#### Declarer

The player who won the bid, often contracting to win a certain number of tricks or points.

#### Defenders

The player or players who are attempting to prevent the declarer's team from fulfilling their contract.

#### Empty Card

In tarot games, this refers to a card that's not worth any points.

#### The Fool

The Fool is a special card in a tarot card. It is frequently treated as the highest ranked card in the trump suit. In other games, it's played as the Excuse and can never win a trick.

#### Forehand

The player sitting immediately to the dealer's left who typically plays the first card of a hand.

#### Hand

A round of play that starts when the dealer shuffles and deals the cards and ends when the cards are collected to be shuffled and dealt by the next dealer.

#### Hard Score

Players who lose a hand "pay" the players who win the required "points." If this is tracked on paper, some players will have negative scores, others positive, and the sum of all of the scores should always be 0.

#### Head the Trick

Play a card that would win the trick if no further cards are played. It's possible that another player may play a higher card to the trick later.

#### Major Suit

In Bridge and Bridge variants, hearts and spades are referred to as major suits.

#### Middlehand

In a three-player game, the player who sits between the forehand and the dealer.

#### Minor Suit

In Bridge and Bridge variants, clubs and diamonds are referred to as minor suits.

#### The Mond

The Mond is trump 21 in a tarot deck. If the Fool is high, it is the second highest trump card. Otherwise, it is the highest.

#### No Trump

No trump means that the hand is played without a trump suit. A trick will always be won by the highest ranked card that was played in the led suit.

#### Overtrick

The number of tricks that a team was over their contract. For example, if a player bid to win 5 tricks and took 8, then they have 3 overtricks.

#### The Pagat

#### Plain Suit

Any suit that is not the trump suit.

#### Rearhand

The player who plays last to the first trick. This is usually the dealer.

#### Stock

Also known as the talon, kitty, or blind. It's the cards that remain undealt once the dealer has finished dealing the hand. These cards may or may not be used, depending on the game.

#### Trick

A round in which each player takes a turn playing a card face up to the table. Once everyone has played, the cards are compared to determine which player takes the trick.

#### Trull Cards

The Pagat, Fool, and Mond are collectively known as the trull cards.

#### Trump

The suit that out ranks all of the other suits.

#### Undertrick

The number of tricks that a team was off their contract. For example, if a player bid to win 5 tricks but only took 3, then they have 2 undertricks.
