# Take Three

Take Three is minor variant I made to Voodoo Prince, a modern, invented game by Reiner Knizia, to make it work with a standard deck of cards.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 4, playing individually

**Cards** A standard 52-card deck. The following cards have special rules:

- **2s** are normally the lowest cards and aces are normally the highest, but if a 2 and an ace of the same suit are played to the same trick, then the 2 outranks the ace.
- **7s** and **9s** split the tricks that they win, giving the winner two tricks instead of one.

**Objective** Wait as long as possible to win 3 tricks, while avoiding being the last player to win 3.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing **11 cards** to each player. The remaining cards are set aside unused.

**Making Trump** On the first hand only, the top card of the undealt cards is turned to determine the trump suit. On subsequent hands, the dealer declarers trump after consulting their hand.

## Play

The **dealer** leads the first trick. Standard trick-taking rules apply, with the notable exceptions described in the cards section above.

Once a player wins **3 tricks** they are done for the hand. They immediately put the remainder of their cards face down on the table, and score 1 point for every trick that has been won so far by any player at the table, **excluding** their own tricks.

For example, if Player A just took their third trick, Player B already has 3 tricks and Players C and D both have 1 each, then Player A scores a total of 5 points.

The hand ends when there is one player remaining who has not won 3 tricks. Unlike the others, this player only scores 1 point for each trick that they personally took and nothing for other player's tricks.

The player who failed to win 3 tricks shuffles and deals the next hand.

## Game

The player with the most points after 5 hands wins.
