# Napoleon

## Preliminaries

**Players** 5, in variable partnership

**Cards** A standard 52-card deck plus one joker, 53 cards. Aces are high. All
of the cards 10 and above are worth one point each, 20 points in total.

There are three special cards that out-rank all other cards, including trump.
These cards still belong to the suit that is depicted on their face, and they must
obey all of the normal rules for following suit. They are as follows, ranked
highest to lowest:

- ♠A, the **Mighty**
- Jack of trump, the **Right Bower**
- Jack of the same color as the trump suit, the **Left Bower**

The joker is the weakest card in the deck. It may be played to any trick, even
if the player could otherwise follow suit, but it can never win a trick. If the
joker is led to a trick, then players _must_ play trump and if they have no
trump they _must_ play a point card. If the joker is led and no one plays trump,
then the joker wins the trick. This is the only way the joker may win a trick.

**Objective** Work with your partner to capture at least as many point cards in
tricks as were bid.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **10 cards** to each player and **3 cards**
to the blind.

## Bidding

**Forehand** starts the auction. Each player must either raise the bid or
pass. Once a player passes they may not bid again. The auction continues until
all but one player have passed. The remaining player is **Napoleon**. If
everyone passes without bidding, the hand is thrown in.

A bid is comprised of the minimum number of card-points the player thinks they
can take in tricks and a trump suit or no trump. The minimum bid is 11. Trump
suits are ranked as in Bridge, (low) ♣, ♦, ♥, ♠, no trump (high). A bid may be
raised by increasing the bid level, changing to a higher ranked suit, or both.

## Calling a Partner

Napoleon takes the blind into their hand and discards down to 10 cards. The
discarded cards count for Napoleon at the end of the hand.

Finally, Napoleon calls the holder of a specific card as their secret partner.
Their identity is only revealed when they play the called card. Napoleon may
call for a card in their own hand, if they want to play alone.

## Play

Napoleon leads the first trick. Standard Whist trick-taking rules apply.

On the first trick only, none of the special cards have their powers and trump
is not yet trump. The first trick is always won by the highest card played in
the led suit with all cards ranked in their usual 2 low through ace high order.

Excluding the first trick, if a trick contains 5 cards of the same suit, or 4
cards of the same suit and the joker, and one of the cards is the 2, then the 2
wins the trick. This is known as the **same two** rule.

The following summarizes what card would win a trick ranked from high to low:

- The Mighty
- The Right Bower
- The Left Bower
- The joker, only if led and no trump are played
- The two, only if the same two rule applies
- The highest trump card
- The highest card in the led suit

Captured point cards are displayed face up in front of the player who took them.
Once the identity of Napoleon's partner is known, each team displays their
cards together.

## Scoring

Napoleon uses hard score. The value of a hand is the number bid minus 10.

If Napoleon's team takes at least as many points as they bid, then two
members of the opposing team each pay Napoleon the value of the hand and the
third member pays Napoleon's partner.

For example, if Napoleon bid 15 and takes 17, Napoleon gains 10 points,
their partner gains 5 points, and each of the other players lose 5 points each.

If Napoleon's team does not take as many points as they bid, then Napoleon pays
two members of the opposing team the value of the hand and their partner pays
the third.

If Napoleon played alone they make and receive all payments.
