# Sheepshead

Sheepshead is an Americanized version of the German game Schafkopf. It is played heavily in Wisconsin, and is an excellent game for 3 or 5 players.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 5, in variable partnership

**Cards** 7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A in four suits, 32 cards. The cards use standard European point-trick rankings and values. There are 120 card-points in total.

Trump The trump suit never changes. It contains the entirety of the ♦ suit, followed by all of the jacks, and then all of queens. The relative ranking of the jacks and queens is by suit as follows: ♦ (low), ♥, ♠, ♣ (high). Laid out, the 14-card trump suit is as follows (low to high):

Card | Points
---- | ------
♦7   | 0
♦8   | 0
♦9   | 0
♦K   | 4
♦10  | 10
♦A   | 11
♦J   | 2
♥J   | 2
♠J   | 2
♣J   | 2
♦Q   | 3
♥Q   | 3
♠Q   | 3
♣Q   | 3

Plain Suits The non-trump suits rank as follows (low to high):

Card | Points
---- | ------
7    | 0 
8    | 0
9    | 0
K    | 4
10   | 10
A    | 11

**Objective** Take more than 60 card-points.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out all of the cards and 2 cards to the talon.

## Picking

Starting with the **forehand**, each player has the option to either pickup the cards in the talon or pass. Picking up the cards obliges the player to take at least 61 card-points in tricks. The player who picks the cards must then discard any 2 cards face down. These cards count towards their total at the end of the hand.

## Calling a Partner

By default, the picker is partnered for the hand with the player who holds ♦J. If the picker holds ♦J in their hand, they may call up to the next higher jack that they do not hold. If they hold all four jacks, they must play alone without a partner.

The player who holds the called jack does not reveal themselves. Their identity becomes known only by playing the called card. The other three, non-picking players work together to attempt to prevent the picker's team from taking 61 or more card-points.

### Going Alone

If the picker is confident in their hand, they may choose to play alone against the other four players. To do this, they must "call their partner off" prior to the first trick. If the picker holds ♦J, and does not call up, they play alone, but no one will realize this until the jack is played.

## Leaster

When no one picks a leaster is played. In a leaster there are no teams, and the goal is to be the player who takes the fewest points. However, in order to win a leaster you must also take at least one trick. The player who takes the final trick also takes the cards in the talon.

## Play

The **forehand** leads the first trick. Standard trick-taking rules apply.

## Scoring

When the hand is over, the picking team counts how many card-points they took to determine which team won the hand.

Hard scoring is used, tracking each player's score individually on paper or with chips. Payments are determined based on the number of points the picker's team took as follows:


Name                 | Condition     | Payment
-------------------- | ------------- | -------
[Lost] **Schwarz**   | No tricks     | -3
[Lost] **Schneider** | 0-30 points   | -2
[Lost] **Game**      | 31-60 points  | -1
[Won] **Game**       | 61-90 points  | 1
[Won] **Schneider**  | 91-120 points | 2
[Won] **Schwarz**    | Every trick   | 3

If the picker's team won, two members of the non-picking team each pay the picker the appropriate points based on the above table, and the third member pays the picker's partner.

For example, if the picking team takes 95 points, making schneider, then the picker gains 4 points, their partner 2, and each member of the non-picking team loses 2 points each.

If the picker's team lost, the opposite transaction happens. The picker must pay two members of the non-picking team, and their partner pays the third.

When the picker plays alone, they either receive four payments or make four payments.

### Leaster

The winner of a leaster is the player who took at least one trick and took the fewest card-points. This player receives 1 point from each of the other players.

## Variations

### Scoring

- When the picker's team loses, the amount they pay is doubled. This is known as "double on the bump."
- If the picker fails to take any tricks, then they are solely responsible for making payments, letting their partner off the hook.

### 3 Players

The 3-player game is identical to the 5-player game, except that the picker always plays alone against the other two players.

### 4 Players

In the 4-player game, ♠7 and ♣7 are removed from the deck, reducing it to 30 cards. The rest of the game is the same, except that now both teams have two players on them. The picker and their partner make and receive payments equally.
