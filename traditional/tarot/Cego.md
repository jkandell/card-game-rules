# Cego

Cego is an unusual tarot game that centers around exchanging cards with a 12-card stock. The variant described here is for 3 players.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 3, in variable partnership

**Cards** 78-card tarot deck minus 1-7 in three suits and 1-6 in the fourth, for a total of **51 cards**. Three suits with 7 cards, one suit with 8 cards, and the trump suit with 22.

The Fool is played as the highest trump.

Cards have their standard values, and cards are counted in **batches of 3**. There are only 69 points in total, but declarer is given an extra point to bring the total to 70, provided they win at least one trick.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Mond (XXI) | 4
Pagat (I)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Take 36 or more card-points to win the hand.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **13 cards** per player and 12 cards to the stock.

## Games

In all games the goal is to take 36 or more card points. The blind or discards always count for the declarer, provided they win at least one trick. The following games are ranked in ascending order:

1. **Solo**: No exchange is made.
2. **Cego**: The declarer keeps 2 cards, discards the rest, takes the blind into their hand, and finally discards 1 more card.
3. **Eine**: The declarer keeps 1 card, discards the rest, and takes the blind into their hand.
4. **One Empty**: The declarer places one pip card faceup on the table, discards the rest, and takes the blind into their hand.
5. **Two Empty**: The declarer places two pip cards of the same suit faceup on the table, discards the rest, takes the blind into their hand, and finally discards the **lowest** trump in their hand (this card must be shown).
6. **Two Different**: The declarer places two pip cards of different suits faceup on the table, discards the rest, takes the blind into their hand, and finally discards the **highest** trump in their hand (this card must be shown).
7. **Pagat**: The declarer places the Pagat faceup on the table, discards the rest, and takes the blind into their hand.

## Bidding

### Phase 1

Starting with the **forehand**, each player either bids "Solo" or passes. If any player bids Solo, bidding proceeds immediately to phase 2.

### Phase 2

If everyone passed in phase 1, then forehand must bid "Cego". Bidding proceeds from here with immediate holds (as in Skat). No jump bids are allowed.

If Solo was bid, then the Solo bidder may no longer bid. The player to their left starts the bidding, which works the same as described above. If both pass, then Solo is played.

After the declarer is determined, they make their exchange as dictated by their game.

## Play

The **declarer** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if they are able, and trump if they cannot. There is no requirement to head the trick.

If the declarer has faceup pip cards, they are played as if they are in their hand.

When playing Pagat, the Pagat must be played to the first trick. However, the player may choose to pick it back up, but by doing so they are committing to Pagat Ultimo. If they fail, they lose the game as if they lost every trick.

## Scoring

The value of the game is determined by subtracting 35 from the winning number of card points, multiplying that value by the factor of the game (see below), and then rounding up to the nearest multiple of 5.

Game          | Not Against Solo | Against Solo
------------- | ---------------- | ------------
Solo          | 2 won or 1 lost  | 
Cego          | 1                | 2
Eine          | 2                | 3
One Empty     | 3                | 4
Two Empty     | 4                | 5
One Different | 5                | 6
Pagat         | 6                | 7

## Variants

- Allow face cards to be made empty if a player does not have the necessary pip cards for an empty game.
- Require the faceup cards to be played to the first tricks.
- Allow Ulti to be bid in the first phase of bidding. It is worth 70 points.
- Double the value of the game when playing against a Solo.
