# Danish Tarok

Danish Tarok is a tarot game with no bidding where the primary objective is to take the final trick with the Pagat or a king. The version of the game described here is a simplification of the rules found on Pagat.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 3, playing individually

**Cards** A 78-card tarot deck, using standard tarot values and rankings. The Fool is played as the Excuse.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Mond (XXI) | 4
Pagat (I)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Take the final trick with either the Pagat or a king.

**Scoring** Hard scoring is used. Points should be tracked with chips or on paper.

## Deal and Discard

Shuffle and deal each player **25 cards**. The remaining 3 cards go to the dealer. After looking at their hand, the dealer discards down to 25 cards. The discarded cards count as being part of the dealer's tricks. The following restrictions apply:

- Kings, the Pagat, the Fool, and the Mond can never be discarded.
- Trump, other than the Pagat and the Mond, can be discarded if, in doing so, the dealer becomes void in trump. After failing to play trump, players may ask the dealer whether they discarded any trump, but not how many.
- Cards that are part of a declarable combination cannot be discarded unless there is no alternative. In this case, the dealer must still declare the combination as normal, and say which cards they discarded.

## Declarations

In turn, each player must declare whether they hold any of the following combinations:

- **Trumps** If a player holds 10 or more trumps, they must declare how many they have. The Fool counts as trump here. Additionally, if a player makes this declaration, they must reveal whether they hold the Pagat.
- **Matadors** If a player holds the Fool, the Pagat, and the Mond, they must declare how many matadors they hold. The basic declaration is "**3 matadors**." This number increases by one for each trump card the player holds in sequence with the Mond. For example, the Fool, the Pagat, the Mond, XX, and XIX is "**5 matadors**."
- **Cavallerie** If a player holds all 4 court cards in a suit, they must declare "**full *[suit]***," naming the suit of the holding. If they also hold the Fool, then they declare "**abundant *[suit]***" instead. Finally, if they have the Fool but only 3 court cards, they must declare "**half *[suit]***, **no *[missing card]***," naming the card they lack.
- **Kings** If a player holds all 4 kings, they must declare "**full kings**." If they also hold the Fool, then they declare "**abundant kings**" instead. Finally, if they have the Fool but only 3 kings, they must declare "**half kings, no *[suit]***," name the king they lack.

Each of the other players immediately pays the declaring player for their declarations as follows:

Declaration               | Value
------------------------- | -----
Trumps                    | 10 for 10 trumps, plus 5 for each additional card
Matadors                  | 10 for 3 matadors, plus 5 for each additional card
Abundant Kings/Cavallerie | 15
Full Kings/Cavallerie     | 10
Half Kings/Cavallerie     | 5

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they may play anything. There is no requirement to head the trick. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

Remember that the Fool is played as the Excuse.

If a player plays a king or the Pagat to a trick, excluding the final trick, but does not win the trick, then they must pay **5 points** to each of the other players.

## Payments

After the final trick, payments are made for the hand based on the achievements players made and the number of card-points they took.

Achievement  | Condition                                                                   | Value
------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----
Tout         | Win every trick                                                             | 125
Nolo         | Lose every trick; no tout                                                   | 25
Pagat Ultimo | Win the last trick with the Pagat; no tout or nolo                          | 60
King Ultimo  | Win the last trick with a king; no tout or nolo                             | 60
Last Trick   | Win the last trick when the Pagat or a king are not played; no tout or nolo | 20

A player who makes one of the above achievements is paid the value of the achievement by each of the other players. Players who play the Pagat or a king to the final trick but fail to take the trick must pay the others for a failed ultimo. Failed ultimos are always paid out, regardless of whether there is a tout or nolo.

## Card-Points

Card-points are counted in **groups of three**, using the standard method. Each player subtracts 26 from the number of card-points they made, and then rounds this number to the nearest multiple of 5. The resulting number is the number of points the player gains or loses.

If there is a nolo, card-points are not counted and no payments are made.
