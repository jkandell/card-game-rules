# Droggn

Droggn is a unique tarot game from Austria that uses an unusually sized deck, and features refined, almost modern, bidding and scoring. The focused nature of the game makes it an excellent choice for new tarot players.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 3, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 66-card tarot deck, which can be constructed out of a 78-card tarot deck by removing the bottom 3 cards from each plain suit. The cards have standard tarot values and rankings. The Fool is played as the Excuse.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Trump 21   | 4
Pagat (1)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Capture at least **37 card-points** to win the hand.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **21 cards** per player and 3 cards to the talon.

## Bidding

**Forehand** leads a single round of bidding in which each player must either pass or bid one of the following contracts ranked from low to high:

- **Simple** May exchange with the talon and buy a card.
- **Solo** May exchange with the talon but may not buy a card.
- **Super** May neither exchange with talon or buy a card.
- **Super Mord** May neither exchange with talon or buy a card, and must win every trick.

The player who bids the highest ranked contract is the declarer. Their goal is to take at least 37 card-points in tricks to win the hand. The other two players play in a temporary alliance to stop the declarer.

## Exchange

If the declarer's contract allows them to exchange with the talon, they take the entire talon into their hand and then discard back down to 21 cards. They may never discard the Pagat, the 21, or the Fool, and they may only discard a king if they discard a regular trump card along with it. Discarded trump do not need to be announced.

If the contract does not allow an exchange, the talon is set aside without being examined. The cards in either the declarer's discard or the untouched talon count as part of the declarer's tricks at the end of the hand.

If the contract allows the declarer to buy a card, they do so after the exchange. The declarer may call for any card and the player who holds the card must give it to them. In exchange, the declarer gives them a card from their hand.

## Announcements

Before leading the first trick, the declarer may announce Pagat Ultimo by placing the Pagat face up in front of them. This announcement means that they will attempt to win the last trick with the Pagat. It is illegal for them to play the Pagat before the last trick unless they have no other legal play.

## Play

The **declarer** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they may play anything. There is no requirement to head the trick. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

The Fool is played as the Excuse. If the declarer big Super Mord and holds the Fool, then they can place it on the table before the first trick and thereby use it to win the last trick. This is the only way the Fool can win a trick.

If the Pagat is played to the final trick, regardless of whether or not Pagat Ultimo was announced, it is considered an attempt at Pagat Ultimo. If the Pagat wins the trick, it was successful. Otherwise, it failed.

If the declarer bid Super Mord and loses a trick, then play ends immediately.

## Scoring

Each team counts their card-points. Points are counted in **batches of three**, using the standard method. There are **74 card-points** in total.

If the declarer took at least **37 card-points**, they won the hand and are paid the value of the game by each of their opponents. If they failed, they pay each of their opponents the value of the game. The game is valued as follows based on the contract and number of card-points taken by the winning side:

- **Simple** 20 points plus 1 point per card-point over 37
- **Solo** 40 points plus 1 point per card-point over 37
- **Super** 80 points plus 1 point per card-point over 37

Pagat Ultimo is evaluated independently of who won the game. The team that wins or loses the final trick with the Pagat is awarded or pays 20 points if it was announced or 10 points if it was unannounced. Additionally, if the Pagat is lost in a trick other than the final trick, then the team that played the Pagat loses 5 points. The opponents pay and receive points equally. For example, if one of them lost the Pagat in an early trick, then they'd both owe the declarer 5 points apiece.

Super Mord scores a flat 167, or 187 if the Pagat or the Fool were displayed.
