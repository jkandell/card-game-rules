# French Tarot

French Tarot is a popular modern tarot game for 3 to 5 players. The 5-player game is described first.

## Preliminaries

**Players** 5, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 78-card tarot deck, using standard tarot values and rankings. The Fool is played as the Excuse.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Mond (XXI) | 4
Pagat (I)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Play in temporary partnership to take at least as many card-points as necessary to win the hand.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **15 cards** per player and 3 cards to the stock.

## Bidding

**Forehand** leads a single round of bidding. Each player must either pass or bid one of the following games:

Bid                     | Multiplier | Description
----------------------- | ---------- | -----------
Small                   | 1          | May exchange with the stock
Guard                   | 2          | May exchange with the stock
Guard without the stock | 4          | May not use the stock but it counts in their tricks.
Guard against the stock | 6          | May not use the stock and it counts in their opponents' tricks.

Each successive bid must be higher than the previous. If everyone passes, the hand is thrown in.
Exchange

If the winning bid is **Small** or **Guard**, the declarer exposes the stock for everyone to see, takes the cards into their hand, and then discards back to 15. The discard cards count as part of their tricks. Kings and trull cards may never be discarded. Non-trull trump may be discard if there is no other option, and must be shown to the table.

If the winning bid is **Guard without the stock**, the stock is not exposed, and the cards are counted as part of the declarer's tricks. Finally, if the winning bid is **Guard against the stock**, the stock is not exposed, and the cards are counted as part of the opposition's tricks.

## Calling a Partner

After the exchange, the declarer calls for a partner by naming a king that they do not hold in their hand. A queen may be named if they hold all of the kings. The player who holds the called king does not reveal themselves. Their identity becomes known only by playing the called card. The declarer may call a king that they hold, in which case they play alone against the other four.

## Declarations

Prior to the first trick, declarations are made.

### Handful of Trump

Any player whose hand is more than half trump may declare a handful, and show the required number of trump to the table. For these purposes, the Fool may be counted a trump, but it should only be shown if the player has no other trump concealed. The number of cards necessary to declare a handful varies based on the number of players as follows:

Players | Single Handful | Double Handful | Triple Handful
------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------
3       | 13             | 15             | 18
4       | 10             | 13             | 15
5       | 8              | 10             | 13

### Slam

The declarer may announce a **slam**, stating that their team will win every trick. This is worth an additional bonus if they succeed or penalty if they fail.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick unless a slam was declared, in which case the declarer leads.

Players must follow suit if able and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they may play anything. When playing a suit card, there is no requirement to head the trick. However, whenever a trump is played it must be higher than the highest trump currently in play if possible. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

Remember that the Fool is played as the Excuse.

If the Pagat is played to the final trick, bonus points are awarded to the team that captures it.

If a team has won every trick and leads the Fool to the final trick, then the Fool will win the trick. In this special case, the bonus for Pagat Ultimo is awarded for winning the second to last trick with the Pagat.

## Scoring

Each team counts their card-points. Points are counted in **batches of two**, using the standard method. There are **91 card-points** in total. The number of points the declarer's team needs to win is based on the number of trull cards that they took in tricks as follows:

Trull Cards | Points
----------- | ------
0           | 56
1           | 51
2           | 41
3           | 36

If they took sufficient card-points, then the declarer is paid the value of the game by two of the opponents, and their partner is paid by the third. If they didn't take enough points, then the declarer pays the value of the game to two of the opponents, and their partner pays the third.

If the declarer plays alone, they make and receive all payments.

### Game Value

The value of the game is computed as follows:

- 25 points for game
- **Plus** the difference between the number of card-points the declarer's team took and the number of points they needed to take to win the hand
- **Plus** 10 points if the Pagat was captured in the final trick by the same team that won the hand
- **Minus** 10 points if the Pagat was captured in the final trick by the team that did not win the hand

This value is then multiplied by the multiplier associated to the bid the declarer made (x1, x2, x4, or x6). Finally, bonus points from declarations are added to the result, regardless of who made them.

Bonus                       | Points
--------------------------- | ------
Single Handful              | 20
Double Handful              | 30
Triple Handful              | 40
Successful Announced Slam   | 400
Unsuccessful Announced Slam | -200
Unannounced Slam            | 200

### Scoring Example

The winning bid was Guard. The declaring team made 60 points, the only trull card they captured was the Mond, they lost the pagat in the final trick, and one of their opponents declared a handful. With one trull card, they needed 51 points to win the hand, which they made. The value of the game is computed as follows:

((25 [game] + 9 [point differential] - 10 [lost Pagat]) * 2 [guard]) + 20 [handful] = 68

Each of the opponents lose 68 points, the declarer's partner gains 68 points, and the declarer gains 136 points.
