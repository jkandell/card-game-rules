# Illustrated Tarock

## Preliminaries

**Players** 3, in variable partnership

**Cards** A 54-card tarot deck. The Fool is played as the highest
ranked trump card above the 21.

Card       | Points
---------- | ------
Trump 21   | 4
Pagat (1)  | 4
Fool       | 4
King       | 4
Queen      | 3
Cavalier   | 2
Jack       | 1
Others     | 0

**Objective** Take 36 or more card points to win the hand.

**Deal** Standard procedure, dealing out **16 cards** per player and **6
cards** to the talon.

## Bidding

Starting with **forehand** and continuing in turn order, each player
must bid or pass. Once a player passes they may not bid again. The
player with the highest bid becomes the **declarer**. If everyone
passes, the hand is thrown in and re-dealt.

The available bids, in ascending order, are **Three**, **Two**,
**One**, and **Solo**. The bid indicates the number of cards the
bidder wishes to exchange with the talon, 0 in the case of solo.
Additionally, the higher the bid, the more points the game is worth.

| Contract | Value | Multiplier |
|:---------|:------|:-----------|
| Three    | 3     | 1          |
| Two      | 5     | 2          |
| One      | 7     | 3          |
| Solo     | 10    | 4          |

## Announcements

After the auction and before the exchange, the declarer may make
announcements. Announcements made at this time are worth double. The
defenders may also contra the game or any announcements, quadrupling
their value, to which the declarer may recontra, x16 multiplier. Note,
a contra on the game also contras an announced _Without Trull_ or
_Without Kings_.

_With 40_, _With 50_, and _Valat_ are mounting announcements. For
example, _With 50_ cannot be announced without also announcing _With
50_. They are each evaluated independently during scoring.

Following the exchange and before play begins, the declarer has a
second chance to make announcements. The procedure is the same, but
their values are no longer doubled.

| Bonus         | Value | Silent | Player   | Description                        |
|:--------------|:------|:-------|:---------|:-----------------------------------|
| With 40       | 5     | -      | Declarer | Win at least 40 card points        |
| With 50       | 20    | -      | Declarer | Win at least 50 card points        |
| Valat         | 40    | 20     | Declarer | Win every trick                    |
| Pagat Ultimo  | 10    | 5      | Declarer | Win final trick with Trump 1       |
| Uhu           | 10    | 5      | Declarer | Win 2nd to last trick with Trump 2 |
| Kakadu        | 10    | 5      | Declarer | Win 3rd to last trick with Trump 3 |
| Without Trull | 10    | -      | Declarer | Win game without any Trull in hand |
| Without Kings | 10    | -      | Declarer | Win game without any Kings in hand |
| Trull         | -     | 3      | Any      | All Trull in tricks                |
| Four Kings    | -     | 3      | Any      | All Kings in tricks                |
| Mondfang      | -     | 3      | Any      | Capture opponent's Trump 21        |

## Exchange

If the declarer's contract allows them to exchange cards with the
talon, the entire talon is turned face up on the table and divided
into groups.

If the declarer's contract is _Three_, the first three consecutive
cards are a group and the last three cards are a group. If the
contract is _Two_, the first two cards, middle two cards, and last
two cards are each a group. Finally, if the contract is _One_, each
individual card is in its own group.

The declarer selects one of the groups, adds it to their hand, and
discards the same number of cards face down. The discarded cards count
as part of their tricks at the end of the hand. Cards worth 4 points
may never be discarded. Trump may be discarded if there is no other
choice, but must be discard face up for everyone to see.

The remaining cards that the declarer did not select count for the
opponents at the end of the hand.

If the declarer announced _Without Kings_ or _Without Trull_ before
the exchange, they cannot select a group of cards in the exchange that
contains any of the cards that they announced they were without. If
they have no other choice, then they fail the announcement, but the
game is still played.

## Play

**Forehand** leads the first trick. Players must follow suit if able
and must trump otherwise. If they are unable to do either, then they
may play anything. Otherwise, standard trick-taking rules apply.

## Scoring

Each team counts their card points in **batches of three**, using the
standard method. Fractional values should be rounded to the nearest
integer. There are **70 card points** in total. The declarer needs at
least **36 card points** to win the hand.

Scoring is _not_ hard score and there are no negative points. Instead,
each player scores individually the value of the feat that they won.

The game's value is the basic value of the contract, plus the number
of card points over or under 35, times the contract's multiplier and
any applicable contras.

Announcements are valued at their game point value times the contract
multiplier and any applicable contras.

For example, if the declarer bid _Two_, announced _Pagat ultimo_, and
took 40 card points with a successful ulti. Then, they'd score
`(5 + 5 + 10) * 2 = 40`. On the other hand, if their ultimo succeeded,
but they only took 33 card points, then they'd score `10 * 2 = 20` and
their opponents would each score `(5 + 2) * 2 = 14`.

Game is 100 points.
